# Goal
This template id dedicated to up and running django with kubernetes.

# Setup Development Environment
in order to work with your django application with k8s you need to prepare your environment for development, such as installing docker and minikube for start. so follow along the instructions and make everything.

## Docker Installation
You'll need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
It's available on Windows, macOS and most distros of Linux. 

System requirements
To install Docker Desktop successfully, your Linux host must meet the following general requirements:

- 64-bit kernel and CPU support for virtualization.
- KVM virtualization support. Follow the KVM virtualization support instructions to check if the KVM kernel modules are enabled and how to provide access to the kvm device.
- QEMU must be version 5.2 or newer. We recommend upgrading to the latest version.
- systemd init system.
- Gnome, KDE, or MATE Desktop environment.
- For many Linux distros, the Gnome environment does not support tray icons. To add support for tray icons, you need to install a Gnome extension. For example, AppIndicator.
- At least 4 GB of RAM.
- Enable configuring ID mapping in user namespaces, see File sharing.

Docker Desktop for Linux runs a Virtual Machine (VM). For more information on why, see Why Docker Desktop for Linux runs a VM.

If you're using Windows, it will be expected that you have to install wsl too. [WSL or WSL
2](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/a-linux-dev-environment-on-windows-with-wsl-2-docker-desktop-and-more).

That's because we're going to be running shell commands. You can always modify
these commands for PowerShell if you want.



## Kubernetes Cluster Setup
in order to run the kubernetes cluster you need to install one of the following providers for dev environment
### Docker Desktop (default)
docker desktop already has support for windows,linux and mac so its already there all you have to do is to go to docker desktop settings and enable kubernetes, and wait till installation is completed. after that you will see another icon appears beside docker and shows the status of the kubernetes too.
<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="./docs/docker-desktop-kuber.png"></div>


### Minikube Installation (Optional)
Minikube is Kubernetes tool. It allows you to run Kubernetes locally on your computer. It runs as a single-node Kubernetes cluster within your local computer, making it easy to develop the Kubernetes app.
you can follow the instructions provided here to install it based on your os.

<https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/>

What youâ€™ll need
- 2 CPUs or more
- 2GB of free memory
- 20GB of free disk space
- Internet connection
- Container or virtual machine manager, such as: Docker, QEMU, Hyperkit, Hyper-V, KVM, Parallels, Podman, VirtualBox, or VMware Fusion/Workstation



after installation you have to run the minikube and set it up for usage, so in order to do that just run the following command:
```shell
minikube start
```
<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="./docs/minikube-installation.png"></div>
**Note:** if you want to change the default driver for minikube you can pass the argument like this:
```shell
minikube start --driver=virtualbox
```
which will setup minikube with virtualbox as the default driver. for more information see the documentation in here: <https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/>. by default we will use docker.

when its done you will see the details of the steps and informations.
<div align="center" ><img loading="lazy" style="width:700px" src="./docs/minikube-installation-done.png"></div>


## KubeCTL Installation
The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs. For more information including a complete list of kubectl operations, see the kubectl reference documentation provided here:

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/>

for installing kubectl, you can head to the link down below and choose the right os and start the installation steps:

<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/>

**Note:** for windows users after downloading the file you have to put it in a folder inside C directory and then just add the path to environment variables of the system. then you can access and test it with the following command: ```shell  kubectl version --client```

## Helm Installation (Optional)
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. It is the apt, yum, or homebrew equivalent for Kubernetes. The fundamental unit of Helm is a Helm chart. A set of Helm charts together form a packaged application that can be deployed as one unit. Helm serves two main functions:

- Package Manager: Helm works as a package manager with in-built version and dependencies management.
- Templating Engine: By creating application templates using Helm charts, DevOps personnel can deploy the same application across different Kubernetes clusters such as development, staging, and production with the same set of Kubernetes YAML files.

general installation:
<https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/>

github link for installation installation:
<https://github.com/helm/helm/releases>



## Test Kubectl connection to cluster

Once you have the PATH ready, run the following command to check if your set Kubectl is ready to execute Kubernetes commands:
```shell 
kubectl cluster-info
```
and you should see something similar to this:

## Switch Cluster
if you have already setup more than one cluster you can switch between them by docker icon in system tray and changed the kubernetes cluster from one to another.


# Deployment
## Build docker image
for deployment purposes you need to build the docker image, so it can be used inside the k8s deployment as a refrence.
there are two options here: 

- build locally and push to docker hub
- build locally and use it

the correct way is to build and push to docker hub but as we may be some restrictions just build and use it.
remember that we are using a special naming so follow the commands below to create the images.
after that you can either decide to push it to hub or not.

for building django app:
```shell
docker build -t django_app -f ./dockerfiles/prod/django/Dockerfile .
```

and for nginx app:
```shell
docker build -t nginx_app -f ./dockerfiles/prod/nginx/Dockerfile .
```
if you want to push it to the hub firstly, login to docker with the following command:
```shell
docker login -u username -p password
```

after that just push your apps with the following command:
```shell
docker push [USERNAME]/[IMAGE-NAME]:[TAG]
```

## Deploy with Kubectl
in order to deploy the sample project i have provided 3 services inside the ```k8s``` directory:

- django
- postgres
- nginx

in order to deploy the application using the local cluster you need to apply or create them by kubectl, which will communicate with the cluster and create the needed pods,services,deployments and etc. so just follow the instructions:

### deploy postgres
for setting up postgres first of all you need to setup the config-map first so:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/postgres/config-map.yml
```

after that you need to deploy the pod by the deployment:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/postgres/deployment.yml
```

and lastly i norder for your services to access the database you need to assign a service to it by:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/postgres/service.yml
```
at the end you will end up having the postgres up and running.
if you list all the details you can see that the database is running at this point.
```shell
C:\Users\AliBigdeli\Documents\GitHub\Django-Kubernetes-Template>kubectl get all
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/postgres-6bdb7d69c-sdp4j   1/1     Running   0          28s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP    18h
service/postgres     ClusterIP   10.108.239.104   <none>        5432/TCP   19s

NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/postgres   1/1     1            1           28s

NAME                                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/postgres-6bdb7d69c   1         1         1       28s
```

### deploy django
our main service is our django application which will be communicating with the database. os first of all lets setup config-map
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/django/config-map.yml
```

after that you need to deploy the pod by the deployment:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/django/deployment.yml
```

and lastly to make the service accessible by nginx we need to have a service to be able to connect to:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/django/service.yml
```
at the end you will end up having the django app up and running.
if you list all the details you can see that the django app and database is running at this point.
```shell
C:\Users\AliBigdeli\Documents\GitHub\Django-Kubernetes-Template>kubectl get all
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/django-5b74bd444-jfxq9     1/1     Running   0          22s
pod/postgres-6bdb7d69c-sdp4j   1/1     Running   0          5m35s

NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/django       ClusterIP   10.103.127.206   <none>        8000/TCP   17s
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP    18h
service/postgres     ClusterIP   10.108.239.104   <none>        5432/TCP   5m26s

NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/django     1/1     1            1           22s
deployment.apps/postgres   1/1     1            1           5m35s

NAME                                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/django-5b74bd444     1         1         1       22s
replicaset.apps/postgres-6bdb7d69c   1         1         1       5m35s

```
you can change the default configs and update each one.

### deploy nginx
first you need to deploy the pod by the deployment, nginx will be running with 2 replicas:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/nginx/deployment.yml
```

and also apply the service so we can access the django app though nginx,which will be in load balance mode:
```shell
kubectl apply -f ./k8s/nginx/service.yml
```
at the end you will end up having the all the needed services to run the whole application.

```shell
C:\Users\AliBigdeli\Documents\GitHub\Django-Kubernetes-Template>kubectl get all                            
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
pod/django-5b74bd444-jfxq9     1/1     Running   0             6m47s
pod/my-nginx-c7bb68546-9gfzp   1/1     Running   3 (35s ago)   67s
pod/my-nginx-c7bb68546-fbpgt   1/1     Running   3 (33s ago)   67s
pod/postgres-6bdb7d69c-sdp4j   1/1     Running   0             12m

NAME                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service/django               ClusterIP      10.103.127.206   <none>        8000/TCP       6m42s
service/kubernetes           ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP        18h
service/nginx-loadbalancer   LoadBalancer   10.109.255.31    localhost     80:31245/TCP   63s
service/postgres             ClusterIP      10.108.239.104   <none>        5432/TCP       11m

NAME                       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/django     1/1     1            1           6m47s
deployment.apps/my-nginx   2/2     2            2           67s

NAME                                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/django-5b74bd444     1         1         1       6m47s
replicaset.apps/my-nginx-c7bb68546   2         2         2       67s
replicaset.apps/postgres-6bdb7d69c   1         1         1       12m
```
at the end you need to be able to see the website by opening your localhost on port 80
